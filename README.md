# Diabetes-Supervised-Learning

The purpose of this study is to predict diabetes or prediabetes risk in subjects with the use of CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2015) data. The data was preprocessed using StandardScaler and RobustScaler methods for numerical features, encoding of categorical variables, and class balancing via SMOTE due to the imbalanced nature of the original dataset. Of the 21 features in the raw dataset, the top 10 features were selected after culling the weakest features using filtering, embedding, and wrapper methods. Parameters were chosen using hyperparameter tuning and GridSearchCV. The model results show that XGBoost had the strongest performance when compared against LogisticRegression and Random Forest. This study demonstrates the efficacy of ensemble-based models like XGBoost with better training can achieve reasonable risk prediction for diabetes when compared against linear models.
